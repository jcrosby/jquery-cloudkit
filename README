jquery.cloudkit.js
------------------
An in-browser queryable JSON store for CloudKit.

This plugin is the result of combining TaffyDB, patched for asynchronous
operation, with CloudKit and bundling it as a jQuery plugin. This should still
be considered experimental and subject to change.

Usage
-----

Assuming a CloudKit app hosting "notes" and "things" collections:

var store = $.cloudkit;
store.boot({
  success: function() {
    // insert a 'thing'
    store.collection('things').insert({name:"box"}, {
      success: function(index) {
        // do something with your data
      }
    });
    
    // insert a 'note'
    store.collection('notes').insert({foo:"bar"}, {
      success: function(index) {
        // do something with the note
      }
    });
    
    // update all 'things', setting their name to "boxen".
    // See the TaffyDB docs for the optional second "where" parameter
    // (excluded below) specifying a subset of documents to update.
    store.collection('things').update({name:"boxen"}, {
      success: function(indexes) {
        // do something with your updated data
      }
    });
    
    // delete all 'things' where name is "boxen".
    store.collection('things').remove({name:"boxen"}, {
      success: function(indexes) {
        // your data is now removed
      }
    });
    
    // get all 'notes'
    var notes = store.collection('notes').get();
  }
});

This only scratches the surface of the API provided by TaffyDB. See the TaffyDB
site for advanced JSON queries. Keep in mind, the version of TaffyDB used in
this plugin has been patched to add success and error callbacks for insert,
update, and remove methods. All other methods should work identically.


Building
--------

To build development and minified versions of the plugin:

  $ rake dist

The jsmin gem is required for building the minified version. To install:

  $ gem install jsmin


Running the Tests
-----------------

The CloudKit gem (0.10.0 or greater) is required for testing. To install:

  $ gem install cloudkit

If you are running an older version of CloudKit, you can upgrade like this:

  $ gem update cloudkit

To Test:

  $ rake

Note: You may need to refresh your browser if it launches before rack finishes
starting the test app.
