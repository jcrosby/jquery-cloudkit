jquery.cloudkit.js
------------------
An in-browser query-able JSON store for CloudKit.

This jQuery plugin produces in-browser collections of JSON data that map to a
remote CloudKit service. CloudKit is a schema-free auto-versioned RESTful JSON
store with OpenID and OAuth built in.

Using your in-browser database automatically updates the remote store. Querying
is accomplished via JSONQuery. JSONQuery is a superset of JSONPath. See "Usage"
for examples.

Usage
-----

On the server:

1) Mount two RESTful resource collections -- one for "notes" and another for
   "things" -- in a file called "config.ru" (a rackup file):

   require 'cloudkit'
   expose :notes, :things

   (This will mount the CloudKit REST API: http://getcloudkit.com/rest-api.html
   for "notes" and "things.")

2) Start the server:

   rackup config.ru

3) In an HTML file, include the library. (Instructions for building the library
   are included below in the "Building" section.):

   <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.cloudkit.min.js"></script>

4) In your JavaScript code:

var store = $.cloudkit;

store.boot({

  // booting the store reads the metadata on the server, loads existing data,
  // and configures the local store for use

  success: function() {

    // the local store is now ready

    // create a 'thing'
    store.collection('things').create({name:"box"}, {

      success: function(thing) {

        // the 'thing' resource has now been created locally and posted
        // to the server

        alert(thing.json().name); // this will display "box"

        // update the 'thing'
        thing.update({name:"book"} {

          success: function() {

            // the updated 'thing' resource has been mirrored on the server
            // and is ready for use again

            alert(thing.json().name); // this is now "book"

            // delete the 'thing'
            thing.destroy({

              success: function() {
                // the 'thing' has now been deleted
              }
            }
          }
        })
      }
    });

    // create a 'note'
    store.collection('notes').create({foo:"bar"}, {
      success: function(note) {
        // do something with the note
      }
    });

    // find all 'note' resources
    var notes = store.collection('notes').all();

    // get a specific note
    var note = store.collection('notes').get(some_random_note.id());

    // find all things having a name of 'book'
    var matches = store.collection('things').query("?name='book'");
  }
});

Building
--------

To build development and minified versions of the plugin:

  $ rake dist

The jsmin gem is required for building the minified version. To install:

  $ gem install jsmin

Running the Tests
-----------------

The CloudKit gem (0.10.0 or greater) is required for testing. To install:

  $ gem install cloudkit

If you are running an older version of CloudKit, you can upgrade like this:

  $ gem update cloudkit

To test:

  $ rake

Note: You may need to refresh your browser if it launches before rack finishes
starting the test app.
